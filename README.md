# MidiRoll

Windows app that visualizes a MIDI file in piano roll format. I use this app to examine MIDI files output by other apps such as my [Polymeter MIDI Sequencer](https://victimofleisure.github.io/Polymeter/). Only notes are shown. The app supports scrolling and zooming, and gives detailed information when a note is clicked. Use Ctrl + click to highlight all notes that intersect a given position. The app can also create a video of the piano roll scrolling in real time. The video is output as a PNG frame sequence, and it accounts for tempo changes. The app doesn't currently permit any type of editing. 

The code compiles cleanly in Visual Studio 2012 and probably later versions too. This app is still in alpha and may change significantly, or be absorbed into the Polymeter project.
