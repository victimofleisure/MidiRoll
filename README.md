# MidiRoll

Windows app that visualizes a MIDI file in piano roll format. I use this app to examine MIDI files output by other apps such as my [Polymeter MIDI Sequencer](https://victimofleisure.github.io/Polymeter/). The app doesn't currently permit any type of editing. The app can output a video containing the scrolling piano roll. The video is output as a sequence of PNG frames.

The code compiles cleanly in Visual Studio 2012 and probably later versions too.
